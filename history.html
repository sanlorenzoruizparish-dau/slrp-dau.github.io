				 	<p>The first Filipino Saint is the patron of the new parish along Barangay Dau,Expressway, Mabalacat City, Pampanga. The church was built as an alternative site for Our Lady of Victories Church along Mac Arthur Highway since the church's location wasn't conducive to meditation being in the heart of Dau's business district's noise and congestion.</p>

				 	<h3>In 1986</h3>

					<p>Inspite of energy crisis at that time, the church was constructed through the dedication of the Construction Committe and the generosity of the members, benefactors and friends of the parish. In 1988, the first mass was celebrated in the new church, built on a 1,000 square meter lot donated by the Feliciano Family of Angeles City. After a period of time, people the new site inconvenient and decided to ask the parish priest and the Archbishop to keep the old parish, which the latter granted.<br/ >

					This led to the creation of the new parish. The first parish priest was Msgr. Greorio Binuya, installed by Archbishop Paciano Aniceto in March 17, 1991. The canonical jurisdiction of San Lorenzo Ruiz Parish os composed of Barangays: San Isidro, Lakandula, Sitio Kamalig, and Samsonville may soon be included.</p>
					<br /><br />

					<h3>In March 1991</h3>
				 	<p>Fr. Binuya intiated the building of the church belfry with funds from the installation and the help ofthe parishioners and friends of the cursillo. On the same year, the construction of the cursillo house began. The first cursillo house was blessed by Archbishop Paciano Aniceto. Cursillo sessions are now being held once a week in the parish.</p>

				 	<br /><br />

				 	<h3>In March 1996</h3>
				 	<p>Fr. Ed Musni was installed the new parish priest. He is now the Spiritual Director of the various parish organizations. The active organizations are the EMDC, Adoraction Noctuna, Mother Butler, Com-Lec, CWL, AOP, LOM, HNS, Usherettes, CCD, Youths, Tarcisians, Maidens, and the Church Choir who all contribute to the propagation of the faith. This is being accomplished through the sharing of the Bible's teachings during their visits to Basic Eccelesial Communities (BEC) and the teachin of catechism in public schools. <br/ >

				 	Parish organization also insist in the Liturgical Activities specially during the Lenten Season such as the following: Mass Confessions in which many priests are invited to serve the parishoiners, the Station of the Cross along the roads of the parish, the Renewal of Baptism, the overnight vigil of the Holy Eucharist, and the Baptism of Fire. They also actively participate in the novena masses and processions for feast days especially for the feast of San Lorenzo Ruiz,which is celebrated every September 28.<br/><br />

					At present, the parishioners' concern is the construction of the church ceiling and contributions from members of the parishes are most welcomed.
