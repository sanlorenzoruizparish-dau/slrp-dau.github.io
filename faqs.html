				<h4>Below are some frequently asked questions:<h4>
			</div>
			<div class="container">
			  <dl>
			    <dt>How do I contact San Lorenzo Ruiz Parish?</dt>
			    <dd>
			      <p>Contact our Office Secretary 09161125047 or you can Email us at <a href="mailto:sanlorenzoruizparish.dau@gmail.com">sanlorenzoruizparish.dau@gmail.com</a> </p>
			    </dd>
			    <dt>How do I get to San Lorenzo Ruiz Parish?</dt>
			    <dd>
			      <p>San Lorenzo Ruiz Parish is located at Dau Access Rd, Dau, Mabalacat, 2010 Pampanga.  For a map, <a href="https://www.google.com.ph/maps?espv=2&q=san+lorenzo+ruiz+dau&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi5mImwzb7SAhVMzbwKHVg7CfAQ_AUICigD">click here</a>.</p>
			    </dd>
			    <dt>Where should I park?</dt>
			    <dd>
			      <p>You may park in any available spot - in or outside of the Parish compound.</p>
			    </dd>
			    <dt>What should I wear?</dt>
			    <dd>
			      <p>We want you to feel comfortable. After all, we are thrilled that you're joining us and want you to be more focused on the service than what you're wearing. In the summertime, it's not uncommon to see people wearing sandals, shorts, and a shirt. Others prefer to still put on their "Sunday best," and that's fine too! However, we do request that shorts be of a conservative length (no “short-shorts”) and that in general, clothing be respectable and conservative.</p>
			    </dd>
			    <dt>I’m not Catholic ... so, how do I know when to sit, stand and kneel?</dt>
			    <dd>
			      <p>There’s no need to be self-conscious about the postures and responses used during worship. Most visitors just follow the lead of the San Lorenzo Ruiz parishioners. </p>
			    </dd>
			    <dt>I’m not Catholic ... is it okay for me to participate in communion?</dt>
			    <dd>
			      <p>Communion, or The Eucharist, is the most intimate expression of our faith. Catholics believe that the host is literally the body of Christ, transformed from bread by the Priest presiding over the service. Most evangelicals think of Communion as symbolic, so it makes sense that they are not as strict about having the right relationship to it as Catholics and Orthodox Christians who believe it is a sacrament and the true presence of Christ. So, if you are not Catholic, we ask that you not receive communion.  However, those not receiving the Body of Christ and Precious blood are invited to come forward with their hands crossed over their chests for a special blessing.</p>
			    </dd>
			     <dt>Am I expected to put money in the offering?</dt>
			    <dd>
			      <p>If you are visiting with us, we don't expect you to put money in the offering, and you are welcome to just let it pass you by. If you consider San Lorenzo Ruiz your Church home, we'd love for you to prayerfully consider giving to San Lorenzo Ruiz Parish on a weekly basis.</p>
			    </dd>
			     <dt>When is confession available?</dt>
			    <dd>
			      <p>The Sacrament of Reconciliation is typically offered on Wednesdays and Saturdays, with additional times available in Lent and Advent. Confessions are also available by calling the Parish Office for an appointment.
